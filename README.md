# Ecommerce-site

## Description
* This project is the creation of the back end for an e-commerce site. This application used Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This application displays creation of database using mySQL with models and associations. Then demonstrates the API Routes to perform RESTful CRUD operations displayed in my walk through videos.

## Acceptance Criteria
* GIVEN a functional Express.js API
* WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
* THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
* WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
* THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
* WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
* THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
* WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
* THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
* WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
* THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
